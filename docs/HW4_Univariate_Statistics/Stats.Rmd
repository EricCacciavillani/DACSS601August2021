  In this research project I want to understand what attributes of both the human body and attributes of the heart relate to heart diseases. My interest derives from the fact that I am currently under diagnosis for my own heart related disease and would like to become more versed in understanding what attributes that I myself should look into and moreover gain a better understanding of the terminology in the cardiology field. This will hopefully empower me to be more able to understand the terminology when discussing treatment options with my doctor as my diagnosis continues. I feel this understanding will help put myself more at ease as I go through this tough time and help me not feel overwhelmed by the overall jargon the doctors will be using when discussing any problems I may or may not have. 
  I am particularly going to look at the UCI Heart disease dataset because it correlates directly to real life patient data and is well structured data. In an attempt to see what attributes I should look at when trying to predict heart disease. I want to find out if heart disease is more related to attributes of the body such as age and gender or more so to attributes of the organ itself. As well as understand which features are more related to each other under the guise of heart disease. I am interested in mainly seeing how age, gender, blood pressure, resting electrocardiographic measurement seem to have a impact the overall chances of having a heart disease.

### Features of the data set
*  age: The person’s age in years
*  sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
*  cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)
*  trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
*  chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
*  fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (if > 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
*  restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing * probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria)
*  thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved
*  exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
*  oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot)
*  slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)
*  ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)
*  thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect)
*  target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)

## Import csv file of dataset
```{r imort_csv}
heart_df <- read.csv("Datasets/heart.csv")
```

## Quick look at the dimensions
```{r quick_look_dataframe}
head(heart_df)
nrow(heart_df)
ncol(heart_df)
```

## Summary of heart dataset
```{r quick_look_summary}
str(heart_df)
summary(heart_df)
```

```{r missing_data_graph}
vis_miss(heart_df)
```

There is no missing data for this dataset so no cleaning will be needed. (Thank the data gods!)

## Stat testing age between those with or without heart disease
```{r t_test_age_target}
t.test(heart_df$age ~ heart_df$target, mu = 0, alt = "two.sided", conf = 0.95, var.eq = FALSE, paired = FALSE)
```

The null hypothesis is: there is no difference in average age between those with or without heart disease.

The p-value is near zero, thus we can reject our null hypothesis and with 95% confidence say there is a statistically significant difference between the average age of those who have heart disease vs those who do not.

The confidence interval also does not include zero, therefore, it supports our rejection of the null.

## Stat testing cholesterol between those with or without heart disease
```{r t_test_cholesterol_target}
t.test(heart_df$chol ~ heart_df$target, mu = 0, alt = "two.sided", conf = 0.95, var.eq = FALSE, paired = FALSE)
```

Our null hypothesis states: There is no difference between the average cholesterol levels of a patient with heart disease and of a patient without heart disease.

Our p-value shows that the probability of getting our results/extremes, assuming the null hypothesis is true, will happen 13.6% of the time. Therefore, we cannot reject our null hypothesis.

Also since the 95% confidence interval includes zero, it supports our failure to reject the null hypothesis.

## Stat testing  blood pressure between those with or without heart disease
```{r t_test_blood_pressure_target}
t.test(heart_df$trestbps ~ heart_df$target, mu = 0, alt = "two.sided", conf = 0.95, var.eq = FALSE, paired = FALSE)
```

The null hypothesis is: there is no difference in average blood pressure between those with or without heart disease.

The p-value is 1.3% which is less than 5%, therefore we can reject our null hypothesis and with 95% confidence say there is a statistically significant difference between the average blood pressure of those who have heart disease vs those who do not.

The confidence interval also does not include zero, therefore, it supports our rejection of the null.s

## Displaying the coralation matrix
```{r corr_df}
corr <- cor(heart_df)
```
## Visualize the correlation matrix
```{r corr_df_plot}
corrplot(corr)
```

It is a good rule of thumb to always look at the correlation of each of your features with one another. The correlation map helps when measuring the extent of relationship between multiple variables in one given figure. This helps when trying to decide which features to remove when trying when going about feature reduction for better statistical analysis and modeling. To do this I simply generate a correlation plot map. We can see from the given correlation plot the our dependent variable is least related with fbs, chol, trestbps, restecg because they are between -0.2, and  0.2.

## Deleting not related features
```{r remove_corr_features}
heart_df = subset(heart_df, select = c(-fbs,-chol,-restecg))
```

## Analysis of gender
```{r gender_analysis}
ggplot(heart_df, aes(x= heart_df$sex, fill=heart_df$target)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("Gender") +
  ylab("Gender Count") +
  ggtitle("Analysis of Gender") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Heart disease", labels = c("No", "Yes"))
```

When thinking about gender I would expect more males to have greater heart disease due to the fact they are generally physically bigger individuals and therefore their heart strain must be greater and thus increasing the chances of disease. But upon looking at the data for gender when compared against heart disease, we see that our dataset has more females then males, nearly a 1 to 2 ratio, making our data imbalanced for this feature and as a result we can not use this is untrustworthy for decision making when related to heart disease. 


## Remove gender
```{r remove_gender}
heart_df = subset(heart_df, select = c(-sex))
```

## Density graph for trestbps (resting blood pressure)
```{r plot_trestbps}
ggplot(heart_df, aes(x = trestbps, fill = target)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Heart disease", labels = c("No", "Yes"))
```
![alt text here](Plots/trestbps by target.png)  

There is very little difference between the comparison of the feature trestbps and our target heart disease. So, we can remove this feature before model implementation.

```{r remove_trestbps}
heart_df = subset(heart_df, select = c(-trestbps))
```

## Group the different ages in three groups (young, middle, old)
```{r group_continous_data_of_feature_age}
# Group the different ages in three groups (young, middle, old)
young <- heart_df[which((heart_df$age<45)), ]
middle <- heart_df[which((heart_df$age>=45)&(heart_df$age<55)), ]
elderly <- heart_df[which(heart_df$age>55), ]
groups <- data.frame(age_group = c("young","middle","elderly"), group_count = c(NROW(young$age), NROW(middle$age), NROW(elderly$age)))
```

## Ploting different age groups
```{r plot_age_groups}
ggplot(groups, aes(x=groups$age_group, y=groups$group_count, fill=groups$age_group)) + 
  ggtitle("Age Analysis") +
  xlab("Age Group")  +
  ylab("group Count") +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Age Group", labels = c("Elderfly", "Middle", "Young"))
```
I converted feature age of continuous data into categorical data of young, middle-aged, and elderly. Doing so also gave it a more clean look and simplified look of the given age data. There seems to be more elderly patients than both middle aged and young grouping. This gives us a general look at what kind of patients we are looking at in terms of age.

## Adding the age groups to the dataset
```{r add_new_feature_of_categorical_age}
heart_df <- cbind(heart_df, age_groups = ifelse((heart_df$age<45), 0, ifelse((heart_df$age>=45)&(heart_df$age<55), 1, 2)))
heart_df$age_groups <- as.factor(heart_df$age_groups)
```
## Remove age feature of continous replace with new age_group
```{r remove_old_age}
heart_df
heart_df = subset(heart_df, select = c(-age))
heart_df
```

## Create train/test split
```{r create_train_test_split}
set.seed(2031)
require(caTools)
split = sample.split(heart_df$target, SplitRatio = 0.75)
train = subset(heart_df, split==TRUE)
test = subset(heart_df, split==FALSE)
```

## Create and train a simple decision tree
```{r display_tree}
tree = rpart(target~., data=train, method='class')
prp(tree)
```

## Get results of tree on testing data
```{r tree_test_results}
predictTree = predict(tree, newdata=test, type='class')
table(test$target, predictTree)
(22 + 38)/nrow(test)
```

The model is telling us that the features that chest pain,the number of major vessels, and the maximum heart rate achieved impacts the decision the most when making a decision on whether or not the patient has a heart disease. But sadly we only got a 80% on this model for our testing data, this isn’t terrible but it doesn’t truly capture the full understanding that we would like to see to make a more significant claim. However, this does personally tell me that my own individual chest pain is nothing to scoff as it might truly relate to a more underlying issue.
